# Course introduction

**Be prepared and know what to expect**

The goal of this course is to learn how to use docker and the tools directly related to it via practical examples.

The skills acquired during the course should be sufficient to perform ninety-five percent of the tasks that you may encounter in your work.

There are no special requirements for the course participants. All you need is to be able to use your operating system command shell and be familiar with git version control system and its basic commands.

The course consits of ten learning sessions with a homework assignment for each.

During the learning sessions we will discuss tools and recommended techniques of their usage.

We will not dive deeply into the theory, instead we will try to focus purely on practical aspects and demonstrations of the tools being studied. But don't worry, the accompanying explanations will be enough so that you won't have any questions about what this or that method is used for and why it is used in this particular way and not otherwise.

Each session have a set of recommended materials that you can use to get more details about the session topic.

Of course you will have questions regarding the topics will be covered on sessions and about homework assignments. We will try to answer all your questions during the learning sessions.
